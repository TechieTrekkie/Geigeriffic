<p style="text-indent: 3em"> Geigeriffic is the Processing Sketch that I wrote to interface with the <a href="http://mightyohm.com/blog/products/geiger-counter/">MightyOhm Geiger Counter kit</a> by Jeff Keyzer in order to graph, as well as log the Counts Per Second (CPS), Counts Per Minute (CPM),  equivalent dose (expressed in ÂµSv/hr), and mode of the geiger counter at the time (Different sampling rates, expressed as SLOW, FAST, and INST, which change based on certian thresholds).  This data is transmitted wirelessly from the serial port of the geiger counter using 2 XBee transceivers.  One of the transceivers is connected directly to the geiger counter's serial port using a <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/126">serial adapter</a>, and draws power from the geiger counter's own 2 AAA batteries.  The second transceiver is connected directly to the computer with a <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/247">usb mini adapter</a>.  I was able to configure the XBees to "speak" with each other using CoolTerm (Also had to install a <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">driver</a> to recognize the USB ports as Serial ports).  In the code, only 2 things must be configured.  First, at the top of the code the serial port the XBee is connected to must be changed based on the specific XBee you are using (In Windows it is gonna be COM#, and in Mac just change the letters to match the ones that CoolTerm is connecting to in prefrences).  Secondly, since Geigeriffic also logs the data it recieves, it is important to change the filepath that it is using depending on where you want to store the logged data.  Other than that, it should run fairly easily, although I have not tested it yet on Windows</p>

<p style="text-indent: 3em">I also wrote firmware for the geiger counter's ATTINY 2313 microcontroller that will allow me to plug an <a href="http://adafruit.com/products/746">Adafruit GPS unit</a> into it, and have it broadcast that along with the radiation levels to a computer.  To to this, I repurposed the PULSE I/O pin from the geiger counter in order to control a relay, which switches between allowing geiger counter data to transmit, and GPS data to transmit,  since the XBee can only handle one transmission at a time to avoid garbling.  The same Processing grapher code should work for both modified and unmodified geiger firmware to accomodate those unwilling to change the firmware itself.  To change the firmware I downloaded AVRStudio 4, and used an Atmel AVR programmer Mk II to upload the code to the ICSP port of the geiger counter.</p>
