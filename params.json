{"google":"UA-33268624-1","body":"Geigeriffic\r\n===========\r\n\r\nGeigeriffic is the Processing Sketch that I wrote to interface with the MightyOhm Geiger Counter kit in order to graph as well as log the Counts Per Second (CPS), Counts Per Minute (CPM), the equivalent dose (expressed in ÂµSv/hr), and state the mode of the geiger counter at the time (Different sampling rates, expressed as SLOW, FAST, and INST, which change based on certian thresholds).  This data is transmitted wirelessly from the serial port of the geiger counter using 2 XBee transceivers.  One of the transceivers is connected directly to the geiger counter's serial port using a serial adapter, and draws power from the geiger counter's own 2 AAA batteries.  The second transceiver is connected directly to the computer with a usb adapter.  I was able to configure the XBees to \"speak\" with each other using CoolTerm (Also had to install a driver here: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm since using a Mac).  In the code, only 2 things must be configured.  First, at the top of the code the serial port the XBee is connected to must be changed based on the specific XBee you are using (In Windows it is gonna be COM#, and in Mac just change the letters to match the ones that CoolTerm is connecting to in prefrences).  Secondly, since Geigeriffic also logs the data it recieves, it is important to change the filepath that it is using depending on where you want to store the logged data.  Other than that, it should run fairly easily, although I have not tested it yet on Windows\r\n\r\nI am also in the process of writing firmware for the geiger counter's ATTINY microcontroller that will allow me to plug a GPS unit into it, and have it broadcast that along with the radiation levels.  This is still a work in progress, and I will post as I make improvements and achieve milestones.\r\n\r\n-TechieTrekkie","note":"Don't delete this file!
